# CSS Layouts Demo
The code is deployed here: http://css-layouts.herokuapp.com/

This was started as an exploration of the CSS flexbox layout a few years ago, but later I extended it to include CSS Grid and a couple of the older traditional method to compose layouts in CSS. I used this as part of my demo for a presentation I gave on CSS Grid last year.
